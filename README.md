# GIPODÂ² public API
The [GIPOD](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/informatie-vlaanderen/producten-diensten/generiek-informatieplatform-openbaar-domein-gipod) platform is being renewed during the period 2019-2021. Part of the renewal is a new public api, where the GIPOD information is made available to the public as open data.

Information about the new Public API can be found on our [cocreation site](https://vlaamseoverheid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NGC/pages/1851031592/Public+API+-+DRAFT) in dutch.

## Timeline

In september 2020 the new public API will become available on a beta and staging environment, and rolled out into production shortly after.

On november 23 2020 the current public api (https://api.gipod.vlaanderen.be/) will no longer be available or maintained.

## Support

Comminucation to the outside world about the public API will be done trough this repository. You are also welcome to do suggestions or ask questions. If you wish you can add code examples on using this API to this repository using pull requests, or provide links.

## Disclaimer

We don't offer any SLA on service, data, performance or response times during the development of the new API.
