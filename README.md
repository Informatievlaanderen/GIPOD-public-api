# GIPOD public API
The [GIPOD](https://www.vlaanderen.be/digitaal-vlaanderen/onze-oplossingen/generiek-informatieplatform-openbaar-domein-gipod) platform is being renewed during the period 2019-2023. Part of the renewal is a new public api, where the GIPOD information is made available to the public as open data.

All latest information about the GIPOD open data and public API's can be found on our [co-creation page](https://vlaamseoverheid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NGC/pages/6149669482/Open+data+-+public+API).



## Support

Communication to the outside world about the public API will be done through this repository. You are also welcome to do suggestions or ask questions. If you wish you can add code examples on using this API to this repository using pull requests, or provide links.

## Disclaimer

We don't offer any SLA on service, data, performance or response times during the development of the new API.
