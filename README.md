# GIPOD public API
GIPOD offers open data in the form of OGC services (WMS, WFS, API Features), and a LDES (Linked Data Event Stream).

All latest information about the GIPOD open data and public API's can be found on our [co-creation page](https://vlaamseoverheid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NGC/pages/6149669482/Open+data+-+public+API).

## Support

Communication to the outside world about the public API will be done through this repository. You are also welcome to do suggestions or ask questions. If you wish you can add code examples on using this API to this repository using pull requests, or provide links.

## Disclaimer

We don't offer any SLA on service, data, performance or response times during the development of the new API.
